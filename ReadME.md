### README.md for Lumiverse Strip

#### Project Overview

The "Lumiverse Strip" is an advanced smart lighting system that utilizes WS2812B LED strips to create a dynamic and responsive environment within smart homes. This system integrates various functionalities such as voice control, music ambience lighting, environmental monitoring, motion detection, gesture and app-controlled text display, weather simulation, and circadian rhythm lighting. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how smart lighting can enhance user interaction, adapt to environmental changes, and improve the overall quality of life in residential spaces.

#### Features

- **Voice Control**: Manage lighting settings via voice commands.
- **Music Ambience Lighting**: Sync lights with music for immersive experiences.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Sensors that report real-time data such as temperature, humidity, and air quality.
- **Motion Detection**: Automated lighting adjustments based on detected movement.
- **Gesture and App-Controlled Text Display**: Display messages or alerts through gesture recognition or mobile app interactions.
- **Weather Simulation**: Simulate real-time weather conditions through lighting effects.
- **Circadian Rhythm Lighting**: Adjust lighting to align with natural circadian rhythms to support better sleep patterns and general well-being.
